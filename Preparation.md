Okay, here are more interview questions suitable for a Node.js and React.js fresher, expanding on the previous list:

**V. JavaScript (Further Fundamentals)**

53. **Q: Explain object destructuring and array destructuring.**
    **A:** Destructuring is a JavaScript syntax expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
    *   **Object Destructuring:** `const { name, age } = userObject;` extracts `name` and `age` properties from `userObject` into variables `name` and `age`.
    *   **Array Destructuring:** `const [first, second] = myArray;` extracts the first element into `first` and the second into `second`.

54. **Q: What are the spread (`...`) and rest (`...`) operators? Give examples.**
    **A:** Both use the `...` syntax but in different contexts:
    *   **Spread Operator:** Expands an iterable (like an array or string) or object properties into individual elements/properties. Used for copying arrays/objects, merging them, or passing array elements as individual arguments to functions.
        *   `const arr2 = [...arr1];` (Copy array)
        *   `const obj2 = {...obj1};` (Copy object)
        *   `myFunction(...argsArray);` (Pass array elements as args)
    *   **Rest Operator:** Collects multiple elements or arguments into a single array or object properties into a single object. Used typically in function parameters or destructuring.
        *   `function sum(...numbers) { /* numbers is an array */ }`
        *   `const [first, ...rest] = myArray;` (rest gets remaining elements)
        *   `const { id, ...otherProps } = myObject;` (otherProps gets remaining properties)

55. **Q: What is `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`?**
    **A:** These are static methods on the `Promise` object for handling multiple promises:
    *   `Promise.all(iterable)`: Takes an iterable (e.g., an array) of promises. It returns a single promise that fulfills when *all* the promises in the iterable have fulfilled, resolving to an array of their results. If *any* promise rejects, `Promise.all()` immediately rejects with the reason of the first rejected promise.
    *   `Promise.race(iterable)`: Takes an iterable of promises. It returns a single promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as *one* of the promises in the iterable fulfills or rejects, with the value or reason from that first settled promise.

56. **Q: What is the difference between `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`?**
    **A:** Both are web storage APIs allowing browsers to store key/value pairs locally.
    *   `localStorage`: Stores data with no expiration date. Data persists even after the browser window is closed and reopened. Available across all tabs/windows from the same origin.
    *   `sessionStorage`: Stores data for only one session. Data is cleared when the browser tab/window is closed. Each tab/window has its own separate `sessionStorage`.

57. **Q: Explain the `this` keyword in different JavaScript contexts (global, function, method, arrow function, event handler).**
    **A:** The value of `this` depends on how a function is called:
    *   **Global Context (non-strict mode):** `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js, although less relevant in modern Node modules). In strict mode, it's `undefined`.
    *   **Regular Function Call (non-strict mode):** `this` refers to the global object (`window`/`global`). In strict mode, it's `undefined`.
    *   **Object Method Call (`obj.myMethod()`):** `this` refers to the object the method was called on (`obj`).
    *   **Constructor Call (`new MyClass()`):** `this` refers to the newly created instance of the class/function.
    *   **Arrow Function:** `this` is lexically bound; it inherits `this` from the surrounding scope where the arrow function was *defined*, not where it's called.
    *   **DOM Event Handler (inline or `addEventListener` with regular function):** `this` usually refers to the DOM element that triggered the event. If using an arrow function as the handler, `this` retains its lexical value.

**VI. Node.js (Deeper Dive)**

58. **Q: What are Streams in Node.js? Why are they useful?**
    **A:** Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous fashion, piece by piece (chunks), instead of loading everything into memory at once. They are useful for handling large amounts of data (like large files or network responses) efficiently, improving memory usage and performance. Examples include reading/writing files (`fs.createReadStream`, `fs.createWriteStream`), HTTP requests/responses.

59. **Q: Explain the difference between `module.exports` and `exports`.**
    **A:** In Node's CommonJS module system:
    *   `module.exports`: This is the *actual object* that gets returned when you `require()` a module. By default, it's an empty object (`{}`). You can assign anything to it (an object, a function, a class, a value).
    *   `exports`: This is initially just a *reference* (a shortcut) to the default `module.exports` object. You can add properties to it (`exports.myFunction = ...`), and these will be available on the exported object *as long as you don't reassign `module.exports`*.
    *   **Key Point:** If you assign something completely new to `module.exports` (e.g., `module.exports = myFunction;`), the `exports` variable loses its connection and any properties added directly to `exports` will *not* be exported. It's generally safer and clearer to primarily use `module.exports`.

60. **Q: How can you handle uncaught exceptions in a Node.js application?**
    **A:** While `try...catch` handles synchronous errors and `.catch()`/`try...catch` with `async/await` handles asynchronous errors in promise chains, uncaught exceptions can still crash the application. You can listen for the `uncaughtException` event on the `process` object:
    ```javascript
    process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
      console.error('There was an uncaught error!', err);
      // Perform synchronous cleanup (e.g., logging)
      process.exit(1); // It's generally recommended to exit after an uncaught exception
    });
    ```
    It's crucial to understand that after an uncaught exception, the application might be in an inconsistent state, so attempting to resume normal operation is risky. Logging and exiting gracefully is often the best practice. A similar event `unhandledRejection` exists for promises that reject without a `.catch()` handler.

61. **Q: What is an ORM or ODM? Give an example.**
    **A:**
    *   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):** A technique/library that converts data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages (like JavaScript in Node.js) and relational databases (like PostgreSQL, MySQL using SQL). It allows you to interact with your database using object-oriented paradigms instead of writing raw SQL queries. Examples: Sequelize, TypeORM.
    *   **ODM (Object-Document Mapper):** Similar to ORM, but for NoSQL document databases (like MongoDB). It maps document data (e.g., BSON in MongoDB) to objects in your application code. Example: Mongoose.
    *   **Benefit:** They simplify database interactions, provide data validation, abstract away database differences, and can improve developer productivity.

62. **Q: Briefly explain what Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is in the context of a Node.js backend.**
    **A:** XSS is a security vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious client-side scripts (usually JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. While the execution happens in the user's browser, the Node.js backend can be vulnerable if it:
    *   Takes user input and directly embeds it into an HTML response without proper sanitization or encoding.
    *   Stores user input in a database and later renders it unsanitized on a page.
    *   **Prevention (Backend Role):** The backend must treat all user input as untrusted. It should sanitize input and properly encode output that will be rendered as HTML to prevent injected scripts from executing. Using templating engines with automatic escaping or libraries dedicated to sanitization helps.

63. **Q: What is CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)? Why might you need to configure it in your Node.js/Express API?**
    **A:** CORS is a browser security feature that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain (origin) than the one that served the web page. If your React frontend (e.g., running on `http://localhost:3000`) needs to fetch data from your Node.js API (e.g., running on `http://localhost:5000`), the browser will block the request by default due to the different origins. You need to configure CORS headers on the *server-side* (your Node.js API) to explicitly tell the browser which origins are allowed to access its resources. Libraries like `cors` for Express simplify this configuration.

64. **Q: Have you used any testing frameworks for Node.js (like Jest, Mocha)? What is the basic purpose of unit testing?**
    **A:** (Mentioning Jest or Mocha is good). Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of the software (e.g., a single function or module) are tested in isolation to verify they work correctly. The purpose is to catch bugs early in development, ensure code quality, facilitate refactoring (tests verify functionality isn't broken), and provide documentation for how units are supposed to behave.

65. **Q: Name a few Express middleware functions (built-in or common third-party).**
    **A:**
    *   `express.json()`: Parses incoming requests with JSON payloads (populates `req.body`).
    *   `express.urlencoded()`: Parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (form submissions).
    *   `express.static()`: Serves static files (like HTML, CSS, JS, images).
    *   `cors()` (from `cors` package): Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
    *   `morgan()` (from `morgan` package): HTTP request logger.
    *   Middleware for authentication (e.g., using Passport.js).
    *   Custom middleware for validation, error handling, etc.

**VII. React.js (Deeper Dive)**

66. **Q: What is the `useContext` Hook? How does it relate to the Context API?**
    **A:** `useContext` is a React Hook that allows functional components to subscribe to React context without introducing nesting (like traditional Context Consumers did). It accepts a context object (the value returned from `React.createContext`) and returns the current context value for that context. It makes consuming context values simpler and cleaner within functional components compared to the older Consumer component pattern.

67. **Q: When might you use the `useRef` Hook?**
    **A:** `useRef` returns a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). It's useful for:
    *   **Accessing DOM nodes directly:** You can attach a ref to a DOM element in JSX (`<input ref={myInputRef} />`) and then use `myInputRef.current` to access the underlying DOM node (e.g., to focus an input field: `myInputRef.current.focus()`).
    *   **Storing mutable values that don't cause re-renders:** Unlike state, changing the `.current` property of a ref does *not* trigger a component re-render. This is useful for persisting values across renders without affecting the rendering cycle (e.g., storing interval IDs, previous state values).

68. **Q: Explain the concept of "lifting state up" in React.**
    **A:** When multiple components need to share or reflect the same changing data, the common practice is to move the shared state up to their closest common ancestor component. The ancestor then holds the state and passes it down to the relevant children via props. If children need to modify the state, the ancestor also passes down callback functions (via props) that the children can call to update the state in the ancestor. This maintains a single source of truth and unidirectional data flow.

69. **Q: What are different ways to style React components? (Mention at least two).**
    **A:**
    *   **Inline Styles:** Applying styles directly via the `style` prop using a JavaScript object with camelCased CSS properties (`<div style={{ color: 'blue', backgroundColor: 'lightgrey' }}>`). Good for dynamic styles, but can be verbose and lacks features like pseudo-selectors.
    *   **CSS Stylesheets:** Importing regular CSS files (`import './MyComponent.css';`) and using standard CSS classes (`<div className="my-class">`). Simple and familiar, but class names are global by default, potentially leading to conflicts.
    *   **CSS Modules:** Importing CSS files named like `MyComponent.module.css`. Class names defined in these files are locally scoped by default (e.g., `styles.myClass`), preventing naming collisions. `import styles from './MyComponent.module.css'; <div className={styles.myClass}>`
    *   **CSS-in-JS Libraries (e.g., Styled Components, Emotion):** Writing actual CSS code within your JavaScript files using tagged template literals or object styles. Offers component-level scoping, dynamic styling based on props, theming, and eliminates unused styles.

70. **Q: What is the difference between a Controlled and an Uncontrolled Component in React forms?**
    **A:**
    *   **Controlled Component:** (Covered before, good reinforcement) Form input's value is controlled by React state. Data flows from state to input (`value` prop) and back via `onChange` handlers updating the state. The component state is the single source of truth.
    *   **Uncontrolled Component:** Form input's value is handled by the DOM itself (like traditional HTML forms). You typically use a `ref` (`useRef` Hook) to access the input's current value directly from the DOM when needed (e.g., on form submission). Less code for simple cases, but harder to implement instant validation or conditional disabling/formatting of inputs.

71. **Q: What is React Testing Library? What is its philosophy?**
    **A:** React Testing Library (RTL) is a popular library for testing React components. Its core philosophy is to test components in a way that resembles how users interact with them. Instead of testing implementation details (like component state or instance methods), RTL encourages querying the DOM based on accessible attributes (text content, labels, roles) and simulating user events (clicks, typing). The goal is to write tests that are more resilient to refactoring and give more confidence that the component works for the end-user.

72. **Q: Briefly explain what `React.memo()` does.**
    **A:** `React.memo()` is a higher-order component (HOC) used for optimizing functional components. It memoizes the component, meaning React will skip re-rendering the component if its props have not changed. It performs a shallow comparison of the props. It's useful for preventing unnecessary re-renders of components that receive complex props or render frequently. (Similar concept to `PureComponent` for class components).

73. **Q: Have you heard of Redux or Zustand? Why might a project need a state management library?**
    **A:** (Awareness is key). Redux and Zustand are popular external state management libraries for React. While React's built-in `useState` and `useContext` are sufficient for many cases, a dedicated library might be needed in larger applications when:
    *   State needs to be shared across many components that are not closely related in the component tree (avoiding deep prop drilling).
    *   State logic becomes complex and needs to be managed centrally and predictably.
    *   You need advanced features like middleware for logging/async actions, time-travel debugging, or better state persistence.
    *   They enforce a more structured way to handle state updates.

74. **Q: How would you fetch data in a React functional component?**
    **A:** Typically using the `useEffect` Hook combined with the browser's `fetch` API or a library like `axios`.
    ```jsx
    import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

    function MyComponent() {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);
      const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
      const [error, setError] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        fetch('/api/data') // Or use axios.get('/api/data')
          .then(response => {
            if (!response.ok) {
              throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
            }
            return response.json();
          })
          .then(jsonData => {
            setData(jsonData);
            setLoading(false);
          })
          .catch(error => {
            setError(error);
            setLoading(false);
          });
      }, []); // Empty dependency array means fetch runs once on mount

      if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
      if (error) return <p>Error: {error.message}</p>;
      // Render data...
    }
    ```
    Using `async/await` inside `useEffect` is also common (requires defining an async function inside the effect and calling it).

75. **Q: What is the purpose of the `key` prop when rendering sibling elements without a list (e.g., inside `React.Fragment`)?**
    **A:** While `key` is most known for lists, it can also be crucial when rendering sibling elements conditionally or when their order might change *without* being part of an array `map`. Assigning a stable `key` to such elements helps React differentiate between them and preserve their state or avoid unnecessary re-mounting when the surrounding structure changes. For example, swapping between two components based on a condition might require keys on those components to ensure state isn't accidentally shared or lost. Using `React.Fragment` with a key (`<React.Fragment key={item.id}>...`) is also sometimes necessary when grouping list items without adding an extra DOM node.

**VIII. General / Tooling / Git**

76. **Q: What are some basic Git commands you use frequently?**
    **A:** Common commands:
    *   `git clone <repository_url>`: Copy a remote repository locally.
    *   `git status`: Show the working tree status (changes).
    *   `git add <file>` or `git add .`: Stage changes for commit.
    *   `git commit -m "Your commit message"`: Save staged changes to the local repository history.
    *   `git push`: Upload local commits to the remote repository.
    *   `git pull`: Fetch changes from the remote repository and merge them into the current branch.
    *   `git branch`: List local branches.
    *   `git checkout <branch_name>` or `git switch <branch_name>`: Switch to a different branch.
    *   `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>` or `git switch -c <new_branch_name>`: Create and switch to a new branch.
    *   `git merge <branch_name>`: Merge changes from another branch into the current branch.
    *   `git log`: Show commit history.

77. **Q: What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?**
    **A:**
    *   **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** The standard protocol for transferring files (like HTML, images) on the web. Data is sent in plain text, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
    *   **HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):** An extension of HTTP that uses encryption (usually TLS/SSL) to secure the communication between the client and server. It ensures confidentiality (data is encrypted), integrity (data cannot be tampered with), and authentication (verifies the server's identity via certificates). Essential for sensitive data like logins and payments.

78. **Q: What does a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code mean? Can you name another common status code?**
    **A:**
    *   `404 Not Found`: The server could not find the requested resource (e.g., the URL path doesn't exist).
    *   **Other common codes:**
        *   `200 OK`: Request succeeded.
        *   `201 Created`: Request succeeded, and a new resource was created (often returned after a POST).
        *   `400 Bad Request`: Server couldn't understand the request due to invalid syntax.
        *   `401 Unauthorized`: Client must authenticate itself to get the requested response (needs login).
        *   `403 Forbidden`: Client does not have access rights to the content (authenticated but not permitted).
        *   `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic error message indicating something went wrong on the server.

79. **Q: What is the purpose of a `.gitignore` file?**
    **A:** The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files or directories it should intentionally ignore and *not* track. This is used to prevent committing files that shouldn't be in version control, such as:
    *   Dependency folders (`node_modules/`)
    *   Build output (`build/`, `dist/`)
    *   Log files (`*.log`)
    *   Operating system files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
    *   Secret files or environment configuration (`.env` - though `.env.example` might be committed).

80. **Q: Imagine a simple To-Do list application. What components might you create in React? What API endpoints might you need in Node.js?**
    **A:** (Tests basic design thinking)
    *   **React Components:**
        *   `App`: Main application container.
        *   `TodoList`: Displays the list of tasks.
        *   `TodoItem`: Represents a single task item (display text, maybe a delete button, checkbox).
        *   `AddTodoForm`: Input field and button to add new tasks.
    *   **Node.js API Endpoints (RESTful):**
        *   `GET /api/todos`: Fetch all to-do items.
        *   `POST /api/todos`: Create a new to-do item (request body contains task details).
        *   `PUT /api/todos/:id` (or `PATCH`): Update an existing to-do item (e.g., mark as complete).
        *   `DELETE /api/todos/:id`: Delete a specific to-do item.

This extended list provides more depth and breadth for evaluating a fresher candidate's understanding of the Node.js and React ecosystem. Remember to ask follow-up questions based on their answers!
